Chapter 8.10: Recursive cars in a loop

We have a number of cars on a circular one-way road.

To represent each car, there's an object of class Car with 3 attributes: 

* car position (from pos 0)
* amount of gas the car can drive
* distance to the next car on the road (miles)

ie. (0,4,5) means that the car is in position 0 with gas for 4 miles, and the next car is 5 miles away.

Program prints out log of travel for the whole circle starting with the winning car's original position, cumulative distance it travels as it passes every car on the road, the amount of gas when it approaches each car, and the gas levels after.
